Testcontainers is a testing library that provides easy and lightweight APIs for
bootstrapping integration tests with real services wrapped in Docker
containers. Using Testcontainers, you can write tests that talk to the same
type of services you use in production, without mocks or in-memory services.

[NOTE]
If you are new to Testcontainers, please read
https://testcontainers.com/guides/introducing-testcontainers[What is
Testcontainers, and why should you use it?] to learn more about it.

Let us look at how we can use Testcontainers to test a .NET application using a
Postgres database.

== Create a solution file with a source and test project

Create a .NET source and test project from your favorite IDE. Once the projects
are created, add the following dependencies to the source and test project.

.Source project
[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::{codebase}/src/GettingStarted/GettingStarted.csproj[lines="6"]
----

.Test project
[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::{codebase}/tests/GettingStarted.Tests/GettingStarted.Tests.csproj[lines="6..8"]
----

We have added *Npgsql*, a Postgres ADO.NET Data Provider for talking to the
Postgres database, and *xUnit.net* for testing our service.

== Implement business logic

We are going to create a `CustomerService` class to manage customer details.

First, let us create a `Customer` type as follows:

[source%nowrap,csharp]
----
include::{codebase}/src/GettingStarted/Customer.cs[]
----

Create a `DbConnectionProvider` class to hold ADO.NET connection parameters
(connection string) and create a method to get a database connection, as follows:

[source%nowrap,csharp]
----
include::{codebase}/src/GettingStarted/DbConnectionProvider.cs[]
----

Create a `CustomerService` class and add the following code:

[source%nowrap,csharp]
----
include::{codebase}/src/GettingStarted/CustomerService.cs[]
----

Let us understand what is going on in the `CustomerService` class.

* `_dbConnectionProvider.GetConnection()` gets a database
  connection using ADO.NET.
* `CreateCustomersTable()` method creates the `customers`
  table if it does not already exist.
* `GetCustomers()` method fetches all rows from the
  `customers` table, populates data into `Customer` objects, and returns a list
  of `Customer` objects.
* `Create(Customer)` method inserts a new customer record into
  the database.

Now let us see how we can test the `CustomerService` logic using Testcontainers.

== Add Testcontainers dependencies

Before writing Testcontainers-based tests, let's add Testcontainers
dependencies to the test project as follows:

.Test project
[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::{codebase}/tests/GettingStarted.Tests/GettingStarted.Tests.csproj[lines="9"]
----

As we are using a Postgres database for our application, we added the
Testcontainers https://www.nuget.org/packages/Testcontainers.PostgreSql[Postgres module] as a test
dependency.

== Write test using Testcontainers

Create a `CustomerServiceTest` class in the test project with the following
code:

[source%nowrap,csharp]
----
include::{codebase}/tests/GettingStarted.Tests/CustomerServiceTest.cs[]
----

Let us understand the code in our `CustomerServiceTest` class.

* Declare `PostgreSqlContainer` by passing the Docker image name
  `postgres:15-alpine` to the Postgres builder.
* The Postgres container is started using xUnit.net's `IAsyncLifetime`
  interface, which executes `InitializeAsync` immediately after the test class
  has been created.
* `ShouldReturnTwoCustomers()` test initializes
  `CustomerService`, insert two customer records into the database, fetch all the
  existing customers, and assert the number of customers.
* Finally, the Postgres container is disposed in the `DisposeAsync()` member,
  which gets executed after the test method is executed.

If you run the customer service test, you can see in the IDE's debug output
that Testcontainers pulled the Postgres Docker image from DockerHub if it's not
already available locally, started the container, and executed the test.

Voila! You have your first Testcontainers-based test running.

== Conclusion

We have explored how to use Testcontainers for .NET library to test a .NET
application using a Postgres database.

We have seen how writing an integration test using Testcontainers is very
similar to writing a unit test that you can run from your IDE. Also, any of
your teammates can clone the project and run tests without installing Postgres
on their computers.

In addition to Postgres, Testcontainers provides dedicated
https://www.nuget.org/profiles/Testcontainers[modules] for many commonly used
SQL databases, NoSQL databases, messaging queues, etc. You can use
Testcontainers to run any containerized dependency for your tests!
